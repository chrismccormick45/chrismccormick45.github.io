                            Hello! My name is Chris, and I'm a Junior B.S. Aerospace Engineering student at UCLA. Though I am a transfer student, I have tried my hardest to get involved with as many
                            engineering projects as possible. As you will further down the page, I joined a rover building project at my previous institution, and have joined the Design/Build/Fly (DBF)
                            club at UCLA. I am eager to learn and participate more in DBF, and hope to eventually join the Rocket Project at UCLA. Having gained the experience I have, and seeing all the
                            opportunities available, I am excited to immerse myself in engineering and eventually get a job in the aerospace industry!
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 20px; font-size: 15pt;">
                            Though I am interested in everything having to do with aerospace, I find propulsion systems, aerodynamics, and flight mechanics particularly interesting. After taking
                            my first class fluid mechanics, and learning about compressible flow and forces acting on a given control volume, my passion for airplanes and rockets grew exponentially. To
                            this day, it still amazes me that we are able to launch rockets to other planets and fly 400-ton airplanes around the world using mathematics and physics. I can hardly wait
                            to get a job in the aerospace industry!

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            At UCLA, I have joined the Design/Build/Fly (DBF) club.

                            In Design/Build/Fly (DBF), I decided to join the aerodynmaics subteam. DBF is a club at UCLA that designs and assembles
                            a radio-controlled airplane each year. Each year, the <a style="text-decoration: underline;">AIAA Design/Build/Fly intercollegiate competiton</a> that we compete in has a
                            different set of missions for our plane to complete. the whole team has frequent general meetings in which each subteam discusses each weeks progress and what they might need done from another subteam. Additionally, we brainstorms
                            about how to best and most efficiently design our airplane. For example, this year our plane is required to have removeable
                            wings that can be reassembled in no more than around 10 mins. Therefore, in our general meetings, we discuss different design ideas as well as how testing of previous designs went. Though this is my first quarter on the team,
                            I feel as though I have already learned so much about plane design and collaboration. As previously mentioned, I was a member of a collaborative engineering project at my
                            community college. However, because this project has many more members and because I have been able to get much more hands-on experience with intricate designs and ideas, DBF has already taught me
                            so much more about the collaboration and the engineering process.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            In the aerodynamics subteam, we design the aerodynamic surfaces of the airplane. Though I am still in the "New Member Training" phase, I have already learned how to design a airfoil, how to import it into, and further design it in,
                            SolidWorks from curve points calculated in MS Excel, how to run CFD simulations on airfoils with applications like XFOIL and SimScale, and how to use MATLAB to analyze flight data (from altimeters and speedometers). I look forward
                            to really getting involved with this subteam, and learning more about aerodynamics!
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            In the CAD subteam, we have are tasked with integrating any design ideas, and getting them ready for either 3D printing or laser cutting (if applicable). Additionally, we also work on designing how certain
                            parts will fit together. For example, we are currently working how to mount the erring to the fuselage. After each subgroup settles on a design for any specific part they have been working on, we create the part in 
                            SolidWorks and assemble the plane in an assembly file. This is to ensure that all the plane components fit together as designed, so that subteams can have references for specific components sizes (when designing
                            parts to connect to any alread-designed parts), and to
                            allow the whole team to have a visual of how each component connection should fit together and how they should appear during and after construction.

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 15pt;">
                            Also at UCLA, I decided to enroll in a rocket engineering course. In this course, students were tasked with forming teams
                            to design, test, and assemble two model rockets. Using a model rocket design program called OpenRocket, my team settled
                            on a mainstream design for our first rocket. After 3D modeling it in SolidWorks, with a detachable nose cone and 
                            deployable parachute, we then completely 3D printed the rocket. However, when launch came, the results were lack luster
                            and we did not achieve anywhere near the apogee and speed that we expected.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 15pt;">
                            Therefore, when designing our second rocket, we wanted to do better. So, each team member conducted their own independent 
                            research and suggested ideas to the group. We incorporated parts of the first rocket that worked well, like the number and
                            shape of the fins, but also added new components and experimented with different materials. We made the body tube out of
                            our own fiberglass lay-up that we created, the fins out of laser cut ply wood, we designed a smaller, more aerodynamic 
                            nose cone, we incorporated a new, 3D printed boat tail to increase the speed of our rocket, and also included a new 
                            altimeter. It was satisfying to see our hard work payoff when our rocket exceeding our expectations, achieving an apogee
                            of about 3200 ft and a max speed of about 0.5 Mach. This rocket is pictured on the right.

                            At my previous institution, I joined the robotics club's Mars Rover Team. This team was tasked with the ground-up design
                            and assembly of a radio-controller rover that was capable of navigating rough terrain, driving autonomously, picking up 
                            and dragging heavy objects with its mechanical arm, and analyzing dirt samples for signs of life. 
                            Though I also helped different subteams with assembly, I decided to join the chassis and electrical subteams. On these
                            subteams, I was assigned to design, 3D model, and assemble different components within the rover's chassis. These 
                            components mainly consisted of electrical circuits and their corresponding housing boxes, however I also worked on 
                            assembling different components that connected to the rover's drivetrain.
