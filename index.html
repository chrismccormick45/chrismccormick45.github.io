                            Hello! My name is Chris, and I'm a Junior B.S. Aerospace Engineering student at UCLA. Though I am a transfer student, I have tried my hardest to get involved with as many
                            engineering projects as possible. As you will further down the page, I joined a rover building project at my previous institution, and have joined the Design/Build/Fly (DBF)
                            club at UCLA. I am eager to learn and participate more in DBF, and hope to eventually join the Rocket Project at UCLA. Having gained the experience I have, and seeing all the
                            opportunities available, I am excited to immerse myself in engineering and eventually get a job in the aerospace industry!
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            Though I am interested in everything having to do with aerospace, I find propulsion systems, aerodynamics, and flight mechanics particularly interesting. After taking
                            my first class fluid mechanics, and learning about compressible flow and forces acting on a given control volume, my passion for airplanes and rockets grew exponentially. To
                            this day, it still amazes me that we are able to launch rockets to other planets and fly 400-ton airplanes around the world using mathematics and physics. I can hardly wait
                            to get a job in the aerospace industry!

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            In Design/Build/Fly (DBF), I decided to join the aerodynmaics subteam. DBF is a club at UCLA that designs and assembles
                            a radio-controlled airplane each year. Each year, the <a style="text-decoration: underline;">AIAA Design/Build/Fly intercollegiate competiton</a> that we compete in has a
                            different set of missions for our plane to complete. the whole team has frequent general meetings in which each subteam discusses each weeks progress and what they might need done from another subteam. Additionally, we brainstorms
                            about how to best and most efficiently design our airplane. For example, this year our plane is required to have removeable
                            wings that can be reassembled in no more than around 10 mins. Therefore, in our general meetings, we discuss different design ideas as well as how testing of previous designs went. Though this is my first quarter on the team,
                            I feel as though I have already learned so much about plane design and collaboration. As previously mentioned, I was a member of a collaborative engineering project at my
                            community college. However, because this project has many more members and because I have been able to get much more hands-on experience with intricate designs and ideas, DBF has already taught me
                            so much more about the collaboration and the engineering process.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            In the aerodynamics subteam, we design the aerodynamic surfaces of the airplane. Though I am still in the "New Member Training" phase, I have already learned how to design a airfoil, how to import it into, and further design it in,
                            SolidWorks from curve points calculated in MS Excel, how to run CFD simulations on airfoils with applications like XFOIL and SimScale, and how to use MATLAB to analyze flight data (from altimeters and speedometers). I look forward
                            to really getting involved with this subteam, and learning more about aerodynamics!
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            In the CAD subteam, we have are tasked with integrating any design ideas, and getting them ready for either 3D printing or laser cutting (if applicable). Additionally, we also work on designing how certain
                            parts will fit together. For example, we are currently working how to mount the erring to the fuselage. After each subgroup settles on a design for any specific part they have been working on, we create the part in 
                            SolidWorks and assemble the plane in an assembly file. This is to ensure that all the plane components fit together as designed, so that subteams can have references for specific components sizes (when designing
                            parts to connect to any alread-designed parts), and to
                            allow the whole team to have a visual of how each component connection should fit together and how they should appear during and after construction.

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            During this quarter (Fall 2022), I enrolled in a rocket engineering course. This course is meant to teach students about the
                            rocket desinging process, and to familiarize students with common engineering tools and applications. In this course, students form
                            groups and design two model rockets - the design of the first rocket is to prepare the students for the second, larger and more powerful rocket.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;"> 
                            For the first rocket, my group consisted of myself and one of my classmates. We decided it would be best for each of us to independently design a rocket, then compare our designs to create
                            the best final design. For my initial design, before creating and testing my design in OpenRocket (a model rocket design application), I conducted lots of research into rocket design.
                            Based on my research, I found that for speeds our rocket would likely be achieving (with the given motor), a parabolic nose cone with a rounded tip, slightly swept fins, and a relatively short
                            body tube with a boat tail would be optimal. After creating and testing this design in OpenRocket, I compared it with my partner's design. After debate and more testing, we eventually settled on the most optimal
                            design consisting of components from each of our initial designs. After this, we divided up the components, created each part in SolidWorks, and made a final asssembly file. Finally, we 3D printed
                            each part, assembled it, and launched it!
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            For the second rocket, it's still under construction and my partner and I's group grew to 5 total people. Similar to the first design, we each conducted our own research, created our independed designs,
                            and compared results. We are currently in the final stages of our final design process, but we have settled on a few desgins. For example, we are experimenting with different component materials and a few weeks ago,
                            we created a fiberglass layup for the body tube. Additionally, in an effort to reduce weight, we have decided to use plywood for some of the components like the fins, engine mount, and centering rings. So far we have
                            createed a few models in SolidWorks, but are still working out the kinks in each of our designs. Additionally, differently from the first rocket, my group and I have decided to code and wire our own altimeter and launch 
                            switch using Arduino microcontrollers. Once all these components are integrated into the rocket design, we hope to launch and achieve an apogee of about 3000ft!

                            I joined my local community college's Mars Rover Team to further my understanding of physics and
                            engineering. In this project, our team designed a rover to perform a series of tasks such as analyzing dirt samples for
                            life and autonomous retrieval missions. My subgroup applied physics principles to design the rover's' chassis, drivetrain, and arm.
                            Joining this team
                            allowed me, for the first time, to work collaboratively with other students to solve engineering challenges. Every Sunday during the school year, the whole team would meet, integrate all the subgroups parts,
                            and would focus on designing new parts or assembling the rover.
                            In June 2022, our rover was placed in a competition with rovers designed by students from some of the most
                            prestigious universities in the world.
