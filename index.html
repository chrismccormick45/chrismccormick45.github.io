                            Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Chris, and I'm an B.S. Aerospace Engineering
                            student at UCLA. Though I am new to UCLA and have only had the opportunity to get involved with Design, Build, Fly at UCLA (DBF), I look forward to 
                            later joining the Rocket Project, and paticipating in collaborative projects and
                            internships. As you will see further down the page, I have invovled with a few engineering projects over the past couple years.
                            Having gained the experience I have, and seeing all the experience I will gain at UCLA, I can hardly wait to graduate and get a job in the aerospace industry!
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            Currently, my passion in aerospace engineering lies within
                            proposion systems and aerodynamics, but I also find flight and celestial mechanics very fascinating.
                            Seeing all the innovations made by companies like SpaceX,
                            Boeing, Blue Origin, etc. excites me and continues to drive my passion for aerospace engineering. I am incredibly excited to see what the 
                            future holds for aircraft and spacecraft, and how my contributions to the aerospace industry will help mankind further
                            explore the universe!
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            Outside of academics, I love being active and busy! In my free time, I like to surf, work out, play guitar, and explore! This past summer, a couple
                            of by friends and I went on a two-week-long road trip across the country.
                            We were able to hit 31 states and drove a total of 8,969 miles. We saw most of the big cities, like New York (picture on left), Chicago, 
                            and Washington D.C., but we also saw many of the beautiful national parks and rural parts of the country, like Yellowstone, Carlsbad Caverns, and Maine.

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            This school year, 2022-2023, I decided to join the aerodynmaics and the CAD subteams of Design, Build, Fly at UCLA (DBF). DBF is a club at UCLA, where each year we design and construct
                            a remote controlled airplane from the bottom up. Because each year our annual, intercollegiate competition has a
                            different set of requirements, the whole team has frequent general meetings in which each subteam discusses each weeks progress and what they might need done from another subteam. Additionally, we brainstorms
                            about how to best and most efficiently design our airplane. For example, this year our plane is required to have removeable
                            wings that can be reassembled in no more than around 10 mins. Therefore, in our general meetings, we discuss different design ideas as well as how testing of previous designs went. Though this is my first quarter on the team,
                            I feel as though I have already learned so much about plane design and collaboration. As previously mentioned, I was a member of a collaborative engineering project at my
                            community college. However, because this project has many more members and because I have been able to get much more hands-on experience with intricate designs and ideas, DBF has already taught me
                            so much more about the collaboration and the engineering process.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            In the aerodynamics subteam, we design the aerodynamic surfaces of the airplane. Though I am still in the "New Member Training" phase, I have already learned how to design a airfoil, how to import it into, and further design it in,
                            SolidWorks from curve points calculated in MS Excel, how to run CFD simulations on airfoils with applications like XFOIL and SimScale, and how to use MATLAB to analyze flight data (from altimeters and speedometers). I look forward
                            to really getting involved with this subteam, and learning more about aerodynamics!
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            In the CAD subteam, we have are tasked with integrating any design ideas, and getting them ready for either 3D printing or laser cutting (if applicable). Additionally, when the whole
                            team settles on a design, we create each part in SolidWorks and assemble the plane prior to the plane's actual construction. This is to ensure that all the plane components fit together as designed, and to
                            allow the team to have a visual of how each component connection should fit together and how they should appear during and after construction.

                        <p style="padding-top: 15px; font-size: 13pt;">
                            During this quarter (Fall 2022), I am currently enrolled in the engineering course E96R. This course is meant to teach students about the
                            rocket desinging process, and to familiarize students with common engineering tools and applications. In this course, I have contributed to the design of two model rockets.
                            This first rocket was completely 3D printed and designed on SolidWorks. After experimenting with an application called OpenRocket, my partner and I settled on a stream-line
                            desing with trapezoidal fins and a parabolic nose cone. On our second rocket (currently still being designed and manufactured) my partners and I settled on another stream-line
                            design, but this time we did more research into the components of the rocket. We discovered that at the speeds our rocket is projected to achieve, swept and trapezoidal fins are
                            best. Additionally, we found that though many different fineness ratios work, a fineness ratio of about 2 to 2.5 is best for our design. Finally, differently from our first rocket,
                            we are experimenting with a boat-tail. Based on our research, this boat-tail should allow us to achieve a higher apogee and speed. Additionally, we are experimenting with new
                            construction material. Instead of having a completely 3D printed rocket, now our body tube will be made of a fiberglass layup, and out fins, engine mounts, and centering rings
                            will be made out of plywood. Our nose cone and boat tail will likely remain 3D printed. Finally, my team is also going to contruct and code our own altimeter. Using an arduino microcontroller,
                            we will use solder to wire up the rocke for launch and for its altimeter. After integrating all these design components, our rocket is projected to achieve an
                            apogee of around ~2200 ft.

                            I joined my local community college's Mars Rover Team to further my understanding of physics and
                            engineering. In this project, our team designed a rover to perform a series of tasks such as analyzing dirt samples for
                            life and autonomous retrieval missions. My subgroup applied physics principles to design the rover's' chassis, drivetrain, and arm.
                            Joining this team
                            allowed me, for the first time, to work collaboratively with other students to solve engineering challenges. Every Sunday during the school year, the whole team would meet, integrate all the subgroups parts,
                            and would focus on designing new parts or assembling the rover.
                            In June 2022, our rover was placed in a competition with rovers designed by students from some of the most
                            prestigious universities in the world.
